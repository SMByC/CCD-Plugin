    - Disabled to select the item "---" which separate the bands and indices in the combobox
    - Added option and buttons to save and restore the plugin settings to or from a Yaml file
    - Allow showing observed values when there is not enough data to perform change detection to have break lines and predicted values, inform the user about that.
    - Set the focus in canvas to listening the events when map tool is set
    - Refactoring the way to get the plugin configuration. Check if a result is saved and not recall to process it again when Generate is call. Adjusting other things
    - Fix action to center on current coordenate
    - Added a new button for automatically generate plot when a new coordinate is pick on map

    - Refactoring the way to store the widget instance and managing it
    - Several internal UI adjustments
    - Fixed bug when getting user locales
    - Only enable the days of year if the date range is greater than 1 year, because the days of year option is only for a multi-year analysis, fix issue #9
