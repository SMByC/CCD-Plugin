# CCD-Plugin

The CCD-Plugin utilizes PyCCD and data from Google Earth Engine to implement the Continuous Change Detection algorithm to analyze the trend and breakpoints of change over multi-year time series at a given coordinate.

The plugin uses Google Earth Engine to retrieve data for the specified coordinates for all available Landsat satellites, including 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, from Collections 1 or 2. It filters for high-quality data only. The plugin then uses [PyCCD](https://code.usgs.gov/lcmap/pyccd) to calculate the trend and breakpoints using the Continuous Change Detection algorithm.

## Installation

The plugin needs to work:

- Google Earth Engine [plugin](https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/ ): The user needs to have this plugin installed and an active Google Earth Engine (EE) account.
- PyCCD, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn and ploty. These packages are included in the all-in-one zip prepared by each OS: *CCD_Plugin_Windows.zip*, *CCD_Plugin_Linux.zip* and *CCD_Plugin_MacOS.zip* available in the [releases](https://github.com/SMByC/AcATaMa/releases) section. The user needs to (re)install the plugin from "Install from zip" in Qgis.
