# CCD-Plugin

The CCD-Plugin use Google Earth Engine to get Landsat or Sentinel2 datasets and run the Continuous Change Detection 
(CCDC) algorithm to analyze the trends and breakpoints of change over multi-year time series at a given coordinate.

The plugin uses Google Earth Engine to retrieve data for the specified coordinates for all available Landsat satellites, 
including 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, from Collections 1 or 2, or Harmonized Sentinel-2 collection. It filters for high-quality 
data only. Then plugin run over Google Earth Engine the Continuous Change Detection algorithm to find temporal 
breakpoints of the image collection by iteratively fitting harmonic functions to the data.

## Installation

The plugin needs to work:

- Google Earth Engine [plugin](https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/ ): The user needs to have this plugin installed and an active Google Earth Engine (EE) account.
- Plotly. Most of the Qgis versions have this library inside, otherwise the plugin install it automatically.
