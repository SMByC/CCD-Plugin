# CCD-Plugin

CCD-Plugin implements the Continuous Change Detection algorithm using PyCCD and Google Earth Engine to analyze the trend and breakpoints of change over multi-year of the time series for a specific Landsat band at a given coordinate.

The plugin utilizes Google Earth Engine to obtain data for the specified coordinate, filtering for high-quality data only, for all Landsat available right now 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9. The plugin then uses [PyCCD](https://code.usgs.gov/lcmap/pyccd) to calculate the trend and breakpoints using the Continuous Change Detection algorithm.

## Installation

The plugin needs to work:

- Google Earth Engine [plugin](https://gee-community.github.io/qgis-earthengine-plugin/ ): The user needs to have this plugin installed and an active Google Earth Engine (EE) account.
- PyCCD, numpy, scipy and scikit-learn packages are already included in the plugin.
